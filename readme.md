## Feature Engineering and Hypothesis Testing 
--- 
### - In this folder I have applied Feature engineering on my [dataset](https://github.com/apeksha235/data_science/blob/main/Week_3/anime_dataset.csv) made during [Week 3](https://github.com/apeksha235/data_science/tree/main/Week_3) 
### - I also did the Hypothesis testing of: 
       - Chi Squared Test of Independency 
       - One-Way Anova Test 
### I came up with several conclusions that will be helpful for the people who want to decide a story, genre for their anime.
